Psuedocode:
1)read numbers from file
start ifstream
use ifstream to open file
if the file is open
have integer equal integer plus linenumber


2)conversions
for header:
	create the variables, getters and setters
	use doubles to handle decimals
for the .cpp
	set up the setters
	for getters:
		look up conversion formulas online
		have the getters return the double variable while applying the formulas





3)Get sum of multiples
create sum integer
for loop while variable is less than 1000
nested if statement checks modulus 3 or modulus 5
appends value to sum



4)calendar
header:
	create integers for day, month, and year
	create strings for day of week, month, and full date
	create setters and getters
	create void functions to do manipulation
calendar.cpp
	create setters and getters
	setters:
		after setting the value, run the appropriate functions(set_day should run code to find the day of the week, and also check the value for errors)
	getters:
the get date function should print out the day, month, year, and day of the week

seperate functions:
	the check_day function
		go by month. if the value is less than 1 or greater than the last day in the month, then print out invalid date or similar
	the check_month function
		if the string month matches, set the private integer month as a number(like 12 for december)
	the day_of_week function
		create a string array with the days of the week
		create temporary int for day month and year
		create an integer for the complicated formula to calculate what day of the week it is on
		use if statements for 1-7
		set the day of the week string equal to the array with the int from earlier as the index(so like days_of_the_week[integer_from_calculation])
