/*
Write a function named average.
Average will ask the user for input. 
Average will then compute the average value of that input.
Average is defined as the sum of values dived by the number of values.

You will need:
A loop, a counter, and at least one method of keeping track of the grades.


Examples:
	
	 You entered 87.87, the current average is: 87.87
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): 42.42

 You entered 42.42, the current average is: 65.15
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): 34

 You entered 34.00, the current average is: 54.76
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): 99

 You entered 99.00, the current average is: 65.82
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): 100

 You entered 100.00, the current average is: 72.66
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): 2

 You entered 2.00, the current average is: 60.88
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): 1

 You entered 1.00, the current average is: 52.33
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): 0

 You entered 0.00, the current average is: 45.79
Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): -1
average grade: 45.79 

	Please enter a grade (-1 to quit): -1
